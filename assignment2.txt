Explain what is declaration, definition and initialization in JS?

DECLARATION:
It is variable or function that can be declared any number of times. 
The variable is registered using a given name within the corresponding. 
It gives information to the compiler like, name of the variable, type of value it holds and the initial value if any it takes. 
For example function a;

DEFINITION:
It’s a variable that says where the variable gets stored like for example,
 memory for the variable is allocated during the definition of the variable. 
For example function a: {return a ;}

INITIALIZATION:
When you declare a variable it is automatically initialized, 
which means memory is allocated for the variable by the JavaScript engine.
For example var things = “code”;
The variable “things “is initialized with “code”
